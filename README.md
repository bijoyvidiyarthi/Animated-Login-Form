# Animated Login Form (Frontend Project)
<p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript are used to create this animated login form. Along with animation, error handling has been taken seriously and error handling has been done in a very interesting way. 
If the username/password is not entered or the password is wrong, it will move away as soon as the mouse is placed on the login button.</p>
