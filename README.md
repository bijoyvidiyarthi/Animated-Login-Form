# Animated Login Form (Frontend Project)
<p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript are used to create this animated login form. Along with animation, error handling has been taken seriously and error handling has been done in a very interesting way. 
If the username/password is not entered or the password is wrong, the login button will move away from it's current position as soon as the mouse is placed on the login button.</p><be>
